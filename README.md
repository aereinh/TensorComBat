# TensorComBat
Tensor-ComBat is an image harmonization method which adjusts imaging outcomes while controlling for site effects and other covariates using Bayesian tensor response regression (BTRR). The model was motivated from a project which aimed to harmonize voxel-level cortical thickness measures to bolster downstream biological analyses and reproducibility using ADNI-1 neuroimaging data.
